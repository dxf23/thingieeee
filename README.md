# Downloader Template
This is a completely open-source tool that I made as a sort of template for beginner coders looking to get into C# stuff like WebClient or messing around with System in Visual Studio.
Anyways, you are completely free and allowed to take credit for this, as it is a template.
You can build this tool yourself by press the green button called "Code" and pressing "Download ZIP".
You then extract the .zip and open it with Microsoft Visual Studio.
